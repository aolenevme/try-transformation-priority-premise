Write an algorithm which reverses the letters of words in a sentence, like: 
Example input: I drive with Bolt
Example output: I evird htiw tloB


The input is a character array (not a string).

The function needs to work in-place, modifying the input array itself. So that memory consumption should be constant (e.g. temporary variables are allowed).

Don't use any extra arrays, string objects or language-provided functions/libraries.
Written tests for your solution are highly preferred.


Example in Java:
Input: char[] input = ['I',' ','d','r','i','v','e',' ','w','i','t','h',' ','B','o','l','t'];
public static char[] reverseWords(char [] input) {
	/** write your code here */
	return input;
}
Output: ['I',' ','e','v','i','r','d',' ','h','t','i','w',' ','t','l','o','B'];

Example is in Java, but choice of programming language is free.


Please write the code in the web browser, don't copy-paste it from external tools like IDE. Code should be valid for the language you've chosen. You are able to compile and test your solution right here.
